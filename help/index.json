For example: in IMP scoring a single overtrick is not worth much in IMP, while a failed contract vs a made contract is worth a lot. While in MP scoring they are worth the same.\nTo change the scoring method, first display the scoring method by hitting the button: Match Points, International Match Points, Played Scoring Method: MP, or Played Scoring Method: IMP until it shows either Match Points or International Match Points, then hit the Set Scoring Method button.
